   **2. Review Installed Extensions**


     Make a list of all installed extensions
     
     Note when each was installed and by whom (if information is available)
     

**3. Check Extension Details**

    For each extension:
    Click on "Details" to view:
    
    *Permissions required
    *Developer information
    *User reviews and ratings
    *Last update date

Look for these red flags:

    -> Extensions you don't remember installing
    -> Extensions with very few or no reviews
    -> Extensions from unknown developers
    -> Extensions with poor ratings or negative reviews mentioning malware
    -> Extensions that haven't been updated in a long 
    -> Extensions requesting excessive permissions (like "Read and change all your data on websites you visit")



**5. Remove Suspicious Extensions**

     -> Click "Remove" on any extensions that seem suspicious
     -> Confirm the removal when prompted

Look up information about:

    How malicious extensions can harm users
